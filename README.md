# Sudoku-Solver
Learning to use Open CV to recognize a sudoku puzzle and solve it. This project uses the tutorial from AI Shack: http://aishack.in/tutorials/sudoku-grabber-opencv-plot/ to extract information from the image. I will then see if it is possible to output an image with the solution.

The goal is to take an image like this:

![Sudoku Puzzle] 
(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjchao/Sudoku-Solver/master/puzzle.jpg)

and output a solution.
